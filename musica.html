    <h2>Alone Again (Naturally)</h2>
    <p>In a little while from now </p><p>
        If I'm not feeling any less sour</p><p> 
        I promise myself to treat myself</p><p> 
        And visit a nearby tower</p><p> 
        And climbing to the top</p><p> 
        Will throw myself off</p><p> 
        In an effort to</p><p> 
        Make it clear to whoever</p><p> 
        Wants to know what it's like when you're shattered</p><p> 
        Left standing in the lurch at a church</p><p> 
        Were people saying, My God, that's tough</p><p> 
        She stood him up</p><p> 
        No point in us remaining</p><p> 
        We may as well go home</p><p> 
        As I did on my own</p><p> 
        Alone again, naturally</p><p> 
        To think that only yesterday</p><p> 
        I was cheerful, bright and gay</p><p> 
        Looking forward to who wouldn't do</p><p> 
        The role I was about to play</p><p> 
        But as if to knock me down</p><p> 
        Reality came around</p><p> 
        And without so much as a mere touch</p><p> 
        Cut me into little pieces</p><p> 
        Leaving me to doubt</p><p> 
        Talk about, God in His mercy</p><p> 
        Oh, if he really does exist</p><p> 
        Why did he desert me</p><p> 
        In my hour of need</p><p> 
        I truly am indeed</p><p> 
        Alone again, naturally</p><p> 
        It seems to me that</p><p> 
        There are more hearts broken in the world</p><p> 
        That can't be mended</p><p> 
        Left unattended</p><p> 
        What do we do</p><p> 
        What do we do</p><p> 
        Alone again, naturally</p><p> 
        Looking back over the years</p><p> 
        And whatever else that appears</p><p> 
        I remember I cried when my father died</p><p> 
        Never wishing to hide the tears</p><p> 
        And at sixty-five years old</p><p> 
        My mother, God rest her soul</p><p> 
        Couldn't understand why the only man</p><p> 
        She had ever loved had been taken</p><p> 
        Leaving her to start</p><p> 
        With a heart so badly broken</p><p> 
        Despite encouragement from me</p><p> 
        No words were ever spoken</p><p> 
        And when she passed away</p><p> 
        I cried and cried all day</p><p> 
        Alone again, naturally</p><p> 
        Alone again, naturally</p><p>

    <h2>Africa</h2>
    <p>I hear the drums echoing tonight </p><p> 
        But she hears only whispers of some quiet conversation</p><p> 
        She's coming in, 12:30 flight</p><p> 
        The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me towards salvation</p><p> 
        I stopped an old man along the way</p><p> 
        Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melodies</p><p> 
        He turned to me as if to say, "Hurry boy, it's waiting there for you"</p><p> 
        It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you</p><p> 
        There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do</p><p> 
        I bless the rains down in Africa</p><p> 
        Gonna take some time to do the things we never had</p><p> 
        The wild dogs cry out in the night</p><p> 
        As they grow restless, longing for some solitary company</p><p> 
        I know that I must do what's right</p><p> 
        As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti</p><p> 
        I seek to cure what's deep inside</p><p> 
        Frightened of this thing that I've become</p><p> 
        It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you</p><p> 
        There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do</p><p> 
        I bless the rains down in Africa</p><p> 
        Gonna take some time to do the things we never had</p><p> 
        Hurry boy, she's waiting there for you</p><p> 
        It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you</p><p> 
        There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do</p><p> 
        I bless the rains down in Africa</p><p> 
        I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rain)</p><p> 
        I bless the rains down in Africa (I bless the rain)</p><p> 
        I bless the rains down in Africa</p><p> 
        I bless the rains down in Africa (gonna take the time)</p><p> 
        Gonna take some time to do the things we never had</p><p>

    <h2>Everybody Wants To Rule The World</h2>
    <p>Tears For Fears</p><p> 
        Welcome to your life</p><p> 
        There's no turning back</p><p> 
        Even while we sleep</p><p> 
        We will find you</p><p> 
        Acting on your best behavior</p><p> 
        Turn your back on Mother Nature</p><p> 
        Everybody wants to rule the world</p><p> 
        It's my own design</p><p> 
        It's my own remorse</p><p> 
        Help me to decide</p><p> 
        Help me make the most of</p><p> 
        Freedom and of pleasure</p><p> 
        Nothing ever lasts forever</p><p> 
        Everybody wants to rule the world</p><p> 
        There's a room where the light won't find you</p><p> 
        Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down</p><p> 
        When they do I'll be right behind you</p><p> 
        So glad we've almost made it</p><p> 
        So sad they had to fade it</p><p> 
        Everybody wants to rule the world</p><p> 
        I can't stand this indecision</p><p> 
        Married with a lack of vision</p><p> 
        Everybody wants to rule the world</p><p> 
        Say that you'll never, never, never, never need it</p><p> 
        One headline, why believe it?</p><p> 
        Everybody wants to rule the world</p><p> 
        All for freedom and for pleasure</p><p> 
        Nothing ever lasts forever</p><p> 
        Everybody wants to rule the world</p><p>
